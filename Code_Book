Code Book


features: contains the names for all the 561 variables collected.
activities: containts activity names and codes for the 6 activities observed.
subject_test: contains a vector of the subject for every observation of the test set.
X_test: contains the values collected for all observations for all variables of the test set.
y_test: contains the activity code for for every row of X_test.
subject_train: contains a vector of the subject for every observation of the train set.
X_train: contains the values collected for all observations for all variables of the train set.
y_train: contains the activity code for for every row of X_test.
X: binds X_train and X_test.
Y: binds Y_train and Y_test.
subject: binds subject_train and subject_test.
merged: merges subject, Y, and X. This is the dataframe that contains all the oservations, together with the subject and activity info.
extracted: extracts the subject, activity, and all the variables that contain a mean or standard deviation operation.
summary: summarizes the extracted dataframe by subject and activity

The steps followed to create the final "summary" tidy dataset were:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
